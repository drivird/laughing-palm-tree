A cartoon theme typing tutor.

I tried to design it fast paced, exciting and somewhat challenging. The original theme is all about the Trashies because it is my kid's current obsession; and learning should be fun. By replacing the sound and image files content the game's theme can be easily modified.

In order to compile, you will have to modify the MSVC2013 solution properties so that your Cinder directory is well referenced. Mine was at D:\cinder_0.9.0_vc2013 at the time of writing.

Once compiled, if you wish to run this game, you should look into the TypingTutor/bin directory for the executable and artwork.

Some tips:
Esc gives you access to the game menus and let you come back from them. 
F1, in game mode, makes a new screenshot into screens/ directory; useful to record a high score.

Enjoy!
